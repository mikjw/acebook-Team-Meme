Hosted here on Heroku: https://serene-oasis-58904.herokuapp.com/

## How to install and run

1. Clone this repository and navigate to the root folder.

2. Image storage is configured to use Amazon S3. For testing, we recommend changing to use local storage instead: 

In config/environments/development.rb, change this line

```
config.active_storage.service = :amazon
```
to read:
```
config.active_storage.service = :local
```
...then repeat for config/environments/production.rb.

3. Download and install Image Magic from here: https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php

4. In the command line, run:

```bash
> bundle install
> bin/rails db:create
> bin/rails db:migrate

> bundle exec rspec # Run the tests to ensure it works
> bin/rails server # Start the server at localhost:3000
```

## Our approach

<em>See detailed project notes in the original repo's [Wiki!](https://github.com/etelish/acebook-Team-Meme/wiki)</em>

- We worked in 2-day sprints, with daily morning stand-ups
- We paired on the major part of the code, with some individual workload depending on requirements for the day
- We managed tickets using a Trello card wall
- We focused on Capybara feature tests to drive design 
- The majority of pull requests were peer reviewed, meaning any merge conflicts were relatively straightforward to resolve

<em>Trello card wall</em>
